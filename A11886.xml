         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>EE, (gracious Soueraigne) See, how many and great reaſons, both from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and the Author, do draw this Treatiſe to your Sacred hands. From the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: A Sacred, and high ſubiect; requireth a Sacred and ſound Iudgement: The Churches Sacred patrimonie; a Kingly, Sacred patroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: And Sacrilege, a proud and inſolent ſin; a Sacred and powerfull ſcepter to ſuppreſſe it. All which, are only, and moſt eminent, in your moſt Sacred Maieſtie, SKILL, WILL, and POVVER.</p>
            <p>From the Author: This ſeemeth to require a
<pb facs="tcp:17637:3"/> Sacred pen-man too: True. And though I be not of the Tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> yet I hope of the tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> how <hi>Simple</hi> ſoeuer. Yea, behold what intereſt I haue alſo in our Sacred <hi>Dauid:</hi> Euen deuoted to his ſeruice, by my parents, before I was; Thereafter, named in, and after his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties owne name, before himſelfe could know it; yet after knowledge, confirmed: And in his H. Court, almoſt euer ſince, both nurſed, and ſchooled. And ſo is our <hi>Dauid,</hi> the King of my birth; the Maſter of my ſeruice; the father of my name; framer of my nature; and the <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel</hi> of my education; at whoſe feet (no, at whoſe elbow, and from whoſe mouth) I confeſſe I haue ſuckt the beſt of whatſoeuer may bee thought good in me: his iuſt right therefore, and my chiefeſt glorie.</p>
            <p>Becommeth it not well then (SIR), where the Soueraigne proueth a <hi>Salomon;</hi> his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers proue <hi>Nehemiahs,</hi> (though ſparingly here compared?) When He, is <hi>Pater Eccleſiae,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopus aulae,</hi> by authoritie proclaiming, and by practiſe prouoking vnto vertue; they, to ſhunne both ignorance and ſilence? Truly, it goeth neuer better, then when the Church Courteth it, and the Court Churcheth it: for
<pb facs="tcp:17637:3"/> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were brothers.</p>
            <p>But to our purpoſe (SIR). When I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how God hath made you, not onely our Prince, but euen our princely Patriarke, our IACOB; deliuering you from ſo many <hi>Eſaues,</hi> as he did <hi>Jacob,</hi> bringing you home againe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your marriage, as hee did <hi>Jacob;</hi> and alſo, ſetling you in your <hi>Canaan,</hi> more, than hee did to <hi>Iacob:</hi> and againe, ſeeing your Maieſtie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes <hi>Jacobs</hi> vowes to God, <hi>viz.</hi> Defending his faith; building his houſes; but chiefly this, <hi>Of all that thou ſhalt giue me, I will giue the tenth vnto thee,</hi> I had bin too to vnworthily by your Maieſtie named <hi>Jacob,</hi> if I ſhould not, with my ſword in the one hand, and penne in the other, both Court it, and Church it; that is, build vp, with our Royall IACOB, the breaches of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>
            <p>But the breach (SIR) is great; not only in Lime and Stone, but in the liuely Stones of Gods worke, the <hi>Leuits</hi> themſelues. Their Tithes are abſtracted; themſelues diſtracted; and ſo, the Goſpell contracted and confined,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1.</note> that it <hi>Runneth</hi> not, as it ſhould. Your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons pay Tithes; your <hi>Leuites</hi> lacke Tithes; your Lords and Laicks haue been bathed in
<pb facs="tcp:17637:4"/> blood about Tithes. Your poore labourers, may ſay with the true Iſraelites,<note place="margin">Deut. 26.13.</note> 
               <hi>J haue brought the hallowed thing out of mine houſe:</hi> but they cannot ſay on, <hi>And J haue alſo giuen it vnto the Leuites.</hi> Why? Becauſe there commeth a kind of Pirat Ships, with Acts of Parliament in their flags, and carrie all away.</p>
            <p>Your SKIL knoweth this (SIR) beſt of any; your WIL wiſheth it were mended; and God hath giuen you POVVER to performe it. All three are promiſed in your BASILICON DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RON to your Sonne;<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> and according to that promiſe, are all three, in ſome meaſure, begun already by your ſelfe, in annulling in a part, that <hi>Vile Act of</hi>

            <p>I graunt, your Maieſtie hath to doe with many <hi>Achans:</hi> but what are they to the reſt of <hi>Jſrael</hi> hauing <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> on their ſide? Let them appeare at the dores of their tents, and ſhew <hi>Quo iure. Achan</hi> ſtole his; and theirs, will be found little better: A Parliament (ſay they): but this treatiſe, (by Gods grace) ſhall proue, that long before there was either King or Parliament in <hi>Jſrael,</hi> Tithes were taken vp for Gods perpetuall worſhip; and ſo can neuer come vnder the power of Prince or Parliament further, than by their Lawes, to enforce the payment of them according to Gods Law: So all is but ſtealth, or robberie: for, <hi>Nemo potest plus iuris in alium tranſferre, quàm ipſe habet:</hi> The Parliament then, neuer hauing power to diſpoſe of them, The poſſeſſors muſt be in <hi>malà fide.</hi> A Parliament maimed of the chiefeſt member, in a Kings younger age, hath forfeited Chriſt; and may not another Parliament perfect in all the members, in a Kings full and perfect age, recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by knowledge, again reſtore Chriſt? In that Parliament <hi>Leui,</hi> the chiefeſt member, (and
<pb facs="tcp:17637:5"/> whom only, the cauſe concerned) was not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſo, God was vnconſulted; Chriſt his Sonne, forfeited; his Church ſpoyled; the King couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the Commons oppreſſed; was not this a <hi>vile Act?</hi> One Parliament more then (SIR) for Chriſts ſake: it may be, ſome wil <hi>parle</hi> for Chriſt. <hi>Leui</hi> will pleade for himſelfe; he will ſhew the <hi>Law;</hi> he dare now ſay, <hi>Nolumus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid (SIR); though nothing more then your Maieſtie knoweth. It ſuffiſeth me, a poore (yet a truſtie) Souldier, once to haue cried, <hi>Courage,</hi> to his King and Captaine, in the day of danger: and I beſeech God, that as many may admire your Maieſtie for working it, as ſhall enuie me for writing it. But all muſt reſt vpon your Highneſſe more ripe and Royall reſolutions; wherein, and in all the courſes of your Long-wiſhed life, I ſhall euer pray for all ſuch happineſſe, as beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth</p>

            <p>Two things would I aduiſe thee touching it: The cauſes mouing me to it, and the courſe I hold in it. The chiefe cauſe was, his <hi>Maieſties</hi> both example and authoritie, (as I haue ſaid to himſelfe) who, the more Kingdomes God giueth him, the more carefull he is to ſee the Kingdome of heauen repleniſh them: and ſo, directing ſometimes Commiſsioners of all ſorts and Callings, for ſurueying Chriſts Sanctuary in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Scotland, I was for one.

            <p>Some, that had at firſt ioyned themſelues to our Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (more for rapine ſake, as appeareth, then Religion) both Atheiſts, Papiſts, and ſome (in ſhew) Proteſtants, (a Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious trinitie) as they pulled downe the Churches, ſo pilled they the Church-rents: laying this ground, The one ſhall neuer be built, and the other euer begge. The Atheiſt, becauſe hee hath <hi>No Religion,</hi> he muſt haue <hi>All</hi> the Tithes. The Papiſt,
<pb facs="tcp:17637:6"/> diſliking the preſent Religion, thinketh in Conſcience he may take Tithes <hi>in Cuſtodiam.</hi> And the Third, renounceth <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantia eſt mater pietatis;</hi> but yet proteſteth, that <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertas</hi> be <hi>nutrix Religionis,</hi> both blinde and beggerly rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: No skant of ſuch Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>As my ſoule may ſee ioy, I ſorrowed for this, being farre from all hope of gaine, for I am no <hi>Leuite,</hi> and free of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, for I haue no priuate enemie (and I could wiſh, no friend) in the buſineſſe. But when I ſaw their Sacrilege ſo confirmed, as they could picke out more texts for a pecke of Tithes, then (perhaps) for a point of ſaluation: and againe, ſeeing the Prince ſo perplexed to ſee his Churches planted: I was glad to goe to Schoole for my owne direction, finding neuer better grounds, then I receiued from our Diuine <hi>Dauids</hi> owne mouth, <hi>viz.</hi> The Church had euer an inheritance (entitled Tithes) before, vnder, and after the Law: whereupon may ſtand a goodly building. And this for my Motiues.</p>
            <p>Touching the courſe then, I hold in it: I draw the generall word <hi>(Sacrilege)</hi> to the onely point of Maintenance, and Maintenance againe, to that onely, which Scripture calleth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, <hi>viz.</hi> Tithes. The point then to bee confirmed is, <hi>Tithes inheritance, are due to the Miniſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, by the Law of God.</hi> Many doubt of this, as I both heare and reade: but more deliuer their iudgements, then confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me it by good arguments; for in ſuch caſe, Cuſtome is no Law, and Law is not humane, but dependeth onely on God: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And for this cauſe, doe I not skumme the Fathers, or Antiquities, further then I find them play vpon the text, <hi>pro,</hi> or <hi>contra.</hi> Then, as I require not my reaſons to be receiued with the reuerence of a Father: ſo I pray thee (good Reader) reiect them not, as the raueries of a childe: for the one is neither author of lyes, nor the other of Truth. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher taught vs better, To conceit truely of all things, according
<pb facs="tcp:17637:6"/> as they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they are not what they are, becauſe ſuch is our conceit of them. In Diuine teſtimonies then, we are to conſider, <hi>Quis dixit,</hi> and <hi>Quid dictum,</hi> and ſo to <hi>acquieſce:</hi> keeping alwayes that noble Boerean cuſtome, of <hi>Scrutamini Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras:</hi> not <hi>fide implicitâ,</hi> to beleeue all, becauſe ſuch a **** aid ſo. In humane teſtimonies, we are onely to weigh <hi>Quid,</hi> and <hi>quo jure dictum,</hi> not <hi>Quis:</hi> for no ſimple truth reſteth vpon this.</p>
            <p>According to three ages foreſaid, doe I treate of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: before, and vnder the Law, in the firſt part: vnder the Goſpell in the ſecond. Obiections are brought for earch Period, as I haue read or heard them, but moſt part nameleſſe, for I ſeek to cleare the Truth, not to be the Whetſtone of Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ſome obiections, from my owne priuate debating with my ſelfe: all which, I haue ſet downe heere, fearing other men might ſtumble at the ſame: for the Spirit of doubting, is an earthly gueſt, and common: the Spirit of true reſolution, from aboue onely, <hi>Truth</hi> being but One, and <hi>Error</hi> infinite. If all doubts then be not heere peculiarly anſwered, yet the grounds well held, will anſwere all. The Towne of <hi>Abe</hi> in <hi>Phocis,</hi> was preſerued by <hi>Philip Macedo,</hi> when he had deſtroyed all the reſt, becauſe the people of that Towne were free of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. Now, if that <hi>Philip</hi> were to take a ſuruey of our Towns, Boroughes, and Abbeyes: how many <hi>Abbees</hi> would he find? What would he leaue vndeſtroyed?</p>
            <p>The cauſe of mens carel ſneſſe of this ſin now, I take to bee, that Time and Cuſtome, hath giuen it ſuch authority, that it is neither feared, nor admired: where vnder the Law, and Poeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogie of the Iewes, it was moſt-times, as preſently puniſhed, as children whipped at ſchoole: <hi>Vzza</hi> ſtruck dead, <hi>Vzzia</hi> leaper; and <hi>Achan</hi> with his whole race, ſton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Iuſtice, Peace, Religion and Tithing.</note> goeth before King of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, that is, Iuſtice and Righteouſneſſe goe before Peace, and both goe before Tithes, that is, without Peace, no ſetled Religion. Then, Peace is the daughter of Iuſtice, and Religion the Garland of Peace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer then the Iuſt God procureth vs Peace, wee ought to ſettle Religion (in all points) peaceably. And where the Power and Peace is greateſt, there ſhould Religion be pureſt, not <hi>Pooreſt</hi> For Religion once rent, Peace is violated: and Peace violated, breaketh the rod of Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>This courſe began heere <hi>Abraham,</hi> our Patriarch and patterne, with <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> ſo ſoone as by Gods Iuſtice he was made peaceable from thoſe Kings his enemies: he heareth <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> Gods Meſſenger, reuerently: he rendereth him his due, Tithes, thankfully: which two points, paint out to vs generally, the ſubſtance of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

And this courſe followed all the good Kings vnder the Law. So wee would know, why this courſe may not alſo hold after the Law? For heere haue wee the Corner-ſtone of all our building, <hi>viz.</hi> That how ſoone a Prieſt is named, ſo ſoone are Tithes named for his maintenance. So Tithes and Prieſt-hood in generall (not Legall Prieſt-hood) are twins of one time.

                  <p>Secondly, concerning Tithes, wee muſt marke two
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17637:23"/> things: Firſt, As they are the goods of men generally. Secondly, The preciſe number <hi>in quoto,</hi> as they are a Tenth of their goods. And ſo, theſe firſt two thouſand yeeres, though the <hi>quota pars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tithes, for the firſt two thouſand yeeres.</note> was not <hi>(nominatim)</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; yet <hi>Res ipſa,</hi> were to the ſame end employed; and ſo God ſtill worſhipped. Otherwiſe wee may alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt all the other foure generall points of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice: <hi>viz.</hi> God was not for two thouſand yeeres worſhipped, becauſe, no Prieſt named, no times affixed: no place deſigned: and no ſpeciall forme preſcribed: and ſo by a like conſequence, wee may liue after the Law, without all theſe, as before it. But we ſay, all fiue were then <hi>re ipſa,</hi> though more confuſed according to the time. The firſt-borne then diſcharged the Prieſts office: and the beſt of all their goods ſerued them for Tithes.<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> So <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> (the Church being then as in her cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle) were taught by Tradition, before Law,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 7. ad fin.</note> or by the Law of Nature, that whatſoeuer the Earth yeelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, a part (yea a chiefe part thereof) was due to the Lords peculiar worſhippe. And ſo each of them brought out vnto the Lord, according to his labours. Their Labours euen at firſt, went as large as did Church maintenance vnder the Law, out of all the <hi>fruits of the ground,</hi> from <hi>Cains</hi> tillage: And of all the beſtiall of the field, from <hi>Abels</hi> paſturage. Now, he who can diſcerne in theſe two brothers, the Prieſt from the Laick, may as eaſily ſequeſtrate their portions. Morall and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall heere, went all in a manner, confuſedly. Tithes then are <hi>(in quoto)</hi> preciſely named, as ſoone as the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciar (on whom they euer depend) is preciſely named: and both, long before the Law. And ſo for Tithes.</p>
                  <p>Now touching this title, (How Tithes may bee held <label type="milestone">

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:17637:24"/> ſeeing the Law only calleth them ſo? To this we anſwer, It followeth not, A thing is not that which it is, becauſe it is not named as it is. As to ſay, <hi>Abraham</hi> was no Prieſt, becauſe he is not called by the name of Prieſt: for whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſacrificed as firſt borne, were Prieſts. It is vſuall in Scripture, ſometimes to name things peculiarly, before they be indeed ſo: as, the wandring Tabernacle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Stone</hi> which <hi>Iacob</hi> erected as a piller,<note place="margin">Gen. 28.20.21.22. 1.

And ſometime againe, things are in effect that, which they beare no name of, till long after: as <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi> heere, was a Prieſt of an <hi>Order;</hi> but yet not named of an Order till <hi>Dauid</hi> roſe: and alſo Tithes, or that which ſupplied their roome, were not called <hi>(Inheritance)</hi> til the owne fit time. Yet that ſame right, which God had from al beginning in mens goods, was euer in effect Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. And as the Myſteries of ſaluation began to be more cleared (as heere, where God preſented to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> a Prieſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) ſo he maketh <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his goods alſo Orderly, calling them at firſt, Tithes.

                  <p>May I not iuſtly ſay then? (I will, and before God, I <label type="milestone">

And if, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> and <hi>Bleſsing,</hi> be not both of one nature in Time, the Type cannot be perfectly Eternall.

As to our children, they differ onely, that theirs are baſtards, ours Lawfull. And I haue often ſeene Romiſh baſtards, better in <hi>bonis,</hi> then any of the other ſort. And though our children be (as ſeldome) prouided for, yet doth not this endaunger our Church for wealth: for our children ſucceede to it <hi>Iure patris,</hi> not <hi>Predeceſſoris: poſſeſsione,</hi> not <hi>profeſsione,</hi> not as a Pope to a Pope: a <hi>Cardinal</hi> to a Carnal.

                  <p>Yet againe, to avoyde all partialitie in theſe poynts, I confeſſe, firſt, That there may be (in ſome reſpect) too
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17637:56"/> much wiuing in a Church Miniſterie: ſpecially where the patrimony is ſo much impared, Matrimonie might be better ſpared: And ſeeing <hi>Lords</hi> &amp; <hi>Lairds,</hi> haue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured <hi>Leuies</hi> maintenance ſo, as will ſcarſe proue meate to his owne mouth, the leſſe his burthen were, the greater were his libertie in his calling: But the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Pope and vs is, that Nature conformed to Gods Law, leadeth vs: Mans Law, abridging Gods, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth them. If we enacted affirmatiuely, that all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt marry: as the Pope doth his Negatiue, That none ſhal marry: I think it were <hi>aeque peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtrin<expan>

                  <p>Secondly, I confeſſe, That there is no greater Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,<label type="milestone">

                  <p>This is a two edged ſword: one againſt the Pope, whoſe chaire maketh him as great a Prince as any in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: <hi>Let</hi> Baal <hi>plead for himſelfe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iudg. 6.32.</note> Another edge, againſt our Miniſterie, who though they bring no other Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to the Miniſterie, then the Goſpel giueth; yet they prouide for their children, which <hi>Leuie</hi> did not. I anſwere, firſt, for the children: <hi>Leui</hi> did not prouide for them, becauſe hee needed not; for God had prouided alreadie ſufficiently for him and all his.<note place="margin">How Leui may haue Inheritance.</note> In generall, I anſwere, If this Leuiticall Law had bin our firſt ground for Tithes, as it is but a branch of that generall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both they and we claime Tithes, then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had had ſome colour of his coniunction of the Negatiue, and Affirmatiue, as of one nature. And yet by his leaue, That Negatiue was peculiar to that onely Tribe, in the diuiſion of that Land: but the Affirmatiue of Tithes, flowing from our firſt Patterne and Patron, <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> was common to all Nations, as was his Prieſt-hood. For no Nation (ſaue this) was enioyned to diuide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in twelue or thirteene diſtinct Tribes, and ſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the Land among them, and kept themſelues ſtill
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17637:57"/> diſtinguiſhed one from another: and no people (ſaue this) had one onely Tribe, reſerued wholly and onely to the Miniſtery: Therefore the Affirmatiue muſt bee Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, The Negatiue, Temporall.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe, the Equitie of this Negatiue teacheth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> That the Sacred and Ciuill calling; the Word,<note place="margin">Sacred and ciuil callings diſtinct.</note> and the World; Prieſt and Prince, ſhould euer remaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; which two the Pope confoundeth, and all ſuch as doe ioyne ſacred and ſecular publike callings in one perſon.

                  <p>Obiect. <hi>Becauſe their riches and formes are very diuers, if not flat contrary: as conſiſting the one in ſhew, the other in ſubſtance: the one altogether ſpirituall, the other much earthly.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I take <hi>Beggerly</hi> iuſt as you doe, with the Apoſtle there: but on the part of the Goſpell, I take it for <hi>Pouertie.</hi> But what reaſon can be drawne from their rich ſhewing Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and rich aſſured maintenance, to make the ſubſtance of the Goſpel be ſhut vp in vncertainty of ſufficient maintenance? Againe, their rich Rudiments (that is, Typicall glories) had the owne rich and like maintenance too: but their Patrimonie (in this Treatiſe being onely Tithes Inheritance) was alſo rich and certaine, and more due to them, for their ſcattered ſeruices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in their Synagogues, then their Ceremoniall and Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Temple-rites, as we haue proued, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. §. 2. and 3. Should the Goſpell alſo be fruſtrate of this? So as it can neither tell what, nor whom to craue.</p>
                  <p>As for example: Some Pariſhes with vs, doe yeeld for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage Tithes ſome fiftie chalders of victuall, which we may va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue at fiue hundred pound ſterling. Such a <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Laird</hi>) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) muſt be Parſon by vertue of that <hi>Vile Act of Annexation</hi> (as his Maieſtie termeth it.<note place="margin">Baſilicon Doron.</note>) So Tithes are ſtill made <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:17637:60"/> but by Gods Law, to Leuites; by Mans, to Lord and Laicks. But what, and whom now ſhall the Lords Parſon, the Leuite, craue? Surely the Lord-Parſon will (perhaps) giue the Lords Parſon a tenth part of the Lords Tithes, and this he aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him to be leuied of ſuch a tenth part of his flock, as they may agree vpon: and ſo, the leſſe benefit, the more credit; for he makes the poore Parſon, halfe an High-Prieſt; and giues him in lieu of <hi>Decimam, Decimarum Decima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip diuideth with him the profits, ſo doth he proportionally, his Flock: for he receiueth this tenth part, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tenth part of his flock; whereas by <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine,<note place="margin">1.

Is not this a <hi>Beggerly</hi> Miniſtery, both in meanes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? If then we will haue Tithes, why not as the Lord ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them?

So I ſay in this caſe, Chriſt did not onely, not abrogate; but could not ſo much as change the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, becauſe his will to the contrary, was figured, in, and by his Type <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi> For though Chriſt changed the Prieſt-hood, yet hee changed not the Maintenance: Why?

Was <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo idle in gifting; <hi>Iacob</hi> ſo ſuperſtitious in vowing; <hi>Paul</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious in applying <hi>Tithing, Dying, Liuing,</hi> differently in <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec</hi> and the Law, as we may yet wipe Tithing quite out of our Text?</p>

                  <p>Obiect. <hi>The Argument ſeemeth not ſo, but thus: Hee that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth is greater then hee that dyeth. Thus in effect, Both Prieſts,</hi> Melchiſedec <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>but who greateſt? He that liueth, He that tooke, He that bleſſed. Both Prieſts, is taken</hi> pro confeſſo, <hi>or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by</hi> Dauids <hi>teſtimony; not by taking of Tithes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Seeing our point heere is of onely Time, and that you yeeld, He that liueth is the greater Prieſt then hee that is dead, giuing the prerogatiue to the time preſent: Why place you the prerogatiue of <hi>Tithing</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> vpon the preterit time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? For <hi>in bonis, praeſentiae quaeque ſemper optima:</hi> So God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe, <hi>I am,</hi> ſtill; though he both was, and ſhall be. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo, though it be true, that <hi>Melchiſedec decimauit,</hi> Tithed, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> in the preterit, yet that momentary <hi>praeterite</hi> in that one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17637:63"/> onely Tithing, can haue no prerogatiue, ouer <hi>Aarons Preſent,</hi> and two thouſand yeeres ſtanding: and how ſhall he be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prieſt that <hi>Tooke,</hi> then he that <hi>Taketh?</hi> ſeeing you make him that <hi>Liueth</hi> greater then he that <hi>Dyeth?</hi> theſe cannot both hold. Neither can you imagine how to make him a Prieſt for euer, by this text, vnleſſe he performe for euer, ſuch points as are in this text recorded proper to his Prieſt-hood: and theſe are onely <hi>Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Tithing.</hi> To diuide theſe, I thinke verily it goeth againſt all the courſe of theſe texts. But I ſtill ſubmit my ſelfe, and more of this afterwards. And albeit <hi>Dauids</hi> Prophecie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him a Prieſt yet <hi>Paul</hi> heere proueth euen the performance of that Prophecie, from two proprieties of all Prieſt-hood, <hi>Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Tithing;</hi> competent to no Calling, but Prieſthood, and ſo, Reciproke with all Prieſt-hood, elſe, how ſhould wee more haue applied that Prophecie, then <hi>Moyſes</hi> Hiſtorie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. if <hi>Paul</hi> had been ſilent?</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17637:64"/> He firſt <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> then <hi>Tithed:</hi> for that is the right Order, firſt to giue them Spirituall food, before you exact their Carnall.

                  <p>In the fourth verſe, <hi>Tithing</hi> commeth, without (naming) <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> And verſ. 6. <hi>Tithing</hi> goeth before <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>Tithing</hi> againe, alone: and alſo verſ. 9.

                  <p>Or ſhall we diuide <hi>Abrahams</hi> Patriarchſhip from his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and binde the firſt to his Fleſh, the ſecond to his ſeed by Faith? But <hi>Paul</hi> telleth vs plainly, That God <hi>made</hi> Abraham <hi>a Father of many Nations:</hi>

                  <p>But to cleare his Fatherſhip better to whom it belongeth. <hi>Neither are they all children, becauſe they are the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9.7.</note>

But heere (ſay you) he repreſenteth but <hi>Leui</hi> his ſonne by the fleſh, with whom <hi>(Onely)</hi> the compariſon is inſtituted] Firſt (as is ſaid) not onely fleſh: for then, the onely Fleſh had heere been bleſſed in <hi>Abraham:</hi> and ſo <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> not a Perpetuall, but a Carnall type of Chriſt. Secondly, Though it had beene onely the Fleſh, yet not onely <hi>Leui:</hi> for the reaſon of <hi>Leuies</hi> being Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17637:64"/> heere, is as true of all the Tribes, as of <hi>Leui:</hi> for all were alike in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes, as <hi>Leui:</hi> and if we frame not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition generall, thus, <hi>All that were then in</hi> Abrahams <hi>loynes, were tithed in</hi> Abraham; <hi>Leui</hi> can no more come vnder the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption then the reſt.

But if we diſtinguiſh not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to other Scriptures, thoſe <hi>Offerings,</hi> from the proper <hi>Inheritance,</hi> we ſhall confound all: for many oblations might the Prieſts and their males onely, eate of, and no inferior Leuit: ſome, might not remaine vneaten till to morrow; but all, tied to the Temple onely, and Ieruſalem. So ſuch Prieſts (to wit, nine for one) as liued diſperſed, could not liue by thoſe oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So thoſe oblations, were not their inheritance. They muſt haue no inheritance with, or among Iſrael (ſayth the text:) yet muſt they liue mixed with, and among Iſrael; therefore their proper Inheritance muſt run diſperſed with and among Iſrael; and not confined to ſo ſmall a part of Iſrael, as onely Ieruſalem. But ſaith not <hi>Paul</hi> plainly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>The ſonnes of Leui receiuing the Prieſthood, haue a command, to</hi> Tithe <hi>the people?</hi> Is not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17637:72"/> here the command of <hi>Tithing</hi> directly giuen to the ſonnes Prieſts, and to take from the people. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Tithes are inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Prieſtes as well as Leuites.

Againe, what proofe bringeth he to make the firſt and ſecond <hi>Tith</hi> both one, in the third and ſixt yeeres, and to diuide them againe in the firſt, ſecond and fifth yeeres? For ſeeing <hi>Scal:</hi> will haue them (as they are Leuites portion) the firſt, third, and fifth yeeres, all carried vp to Ieruſalem; how liued the poore then all theſe yeeres? And ſeeing hee will haue them for the poore theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two yeeres, (here <hi>M. Selden</hi> pleadeth for mee.) How ſhould the Leuites and Prieſts haue their liue-lode of theſe two yeeres? And I hold this for a ground, that ſo long as the end remaineth,<note place="margin">M. Sel: cap: <hi>2.</hi> § <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> ſo long remaine the meanes deuoted to that end: But Leuies ſeruice, being the end, for which theſe firſt <hi>Tithes</hi> were deuoted, admitteth no intermiſſion, but is yeerely the ſame: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo muſt his meanes be yeerely the ſame. If it be replied, that <hi>Leui</hi> is the firſt enrolled euen in theſe fiue and ſix yeeres with the poore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwere</hi> firſt, Leuies meanes is here ſtrangely abridged, by encroaching of <hi>Strangers, Fatherleſſe</hi> and <hi>Widowes;</hi> where hee was at firſt one and all, now is he but the firſt partner; and yet muſt he abate no point of his ſeruice: whereas God euer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied all ſuch wants, as in that Sabbaticall ceſſation of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17637:73"/> the land, the ſixt yeere yeelded three yeeres encreaſe; but no ſuch matter for this fourth and ſixt yeere: the partners, but not the portion is encreaſed. So <hi>Leui</hi> may abound ſtrangely in the one but beg ſtrongly in the other; for all the beggars are thruſt vpon him. Secondly, Was not <hi>Leui</hi> alſo enrolled for a partner in the Feſtiuall Tithes? yet will not <hi>Scaliger</hi> for this, fruſtrate him of the firſt Tithes: And yet <hi>Iunius</hi> will, making firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, one. So haue we of three Tithings, a threefold confuſion, from three learned Authors: <hi>Iunius</hi> the firſt and ſecond, one. <hi>Scaliger</hi> the firſt and third, one. <hi>Selden</hi> the ſecond and third, one. Which maketh mee rather ſimply cleaue to the words of the Text, then thruſt in commentaries for the ouerthrow of it; or practiſe againſt precept.</p>
               <p>And obſerue, there is neuer danger in diſtinguiſhing theſe points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but euer in confounding.

               <p>
                  <hi>The chiefe queſtion</hi> (ſaies Selden) <hi>among the Diuines, comes to this, Whether, by Gods immediate Morall Law, the Euangelicall Prieſthood haue a right to Tithes, as to their Inheritance in equall degree, as the Laie man hath to his Nine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If euer Tiths were due by Gods immediate Morall Law, they muſt be euer ſo, this is ſure. Then our recourſe muſt ſtill be, in examining, by what Law, Tithes were at firſt due. All Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> had euer Tithes; Before Law by Practiſe, Tradition, Inſtinct of Gods Spirit: Vnder Law, by written Law, agreeable to the former practiſe. Whether both thoſe were Morall, Iudiciall, or Ceremoniall, wee ſhall heare anone. And ſo, what euer prerogatiue thoſe Lawes gaue the Prieſthood aboue the Laitie, the ſame ſtill remaineth. The Tenth was euer firſt to be paied; elſe the nine parts were not the Lay-mans.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or if</hi> (ſaies <hi>Selden) they haue Tithes onely as by humane Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Law, and ſo giuen them for their ſpirituall labours, that is, in briefe, Whether by originall diſtributiue iuſtice, or by commutatiue, they are payable?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How Kingdomes are by their owne Lawes Poſitiue, ſeetled in Tithes, is one thing; and how they ſhould be another thing: And their ſo great differences among themſelues, argueth infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly, that they haue varied from the true foundation. As to Iuſtice Diſtributiue and Commutatiue, they hold alike alſo from the beginning, euen in <hi>Leui</hi> vnder the Law: all had the tenths for their Spirituall labour, diſtributed vnto them; and ſo hath the Goſpell now. As for that Title, <hi>Humane Poſitiue Law,</hi> we muſt haue a good ground to proue, how <hi>Diuine Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Law,</hi> which onely doted Tithes to <hi>Leui,</hi> did reſigne them vnder the power of <hi>Humane Poſitiue Law</hi> for the Goſpell.

                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  <hi>But the firſt opinion was</hi> (ſayes <hi>Selden) That the Tenth conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> quoad quotam partem, <hi>&amp;c. is due onely by Law Poſitiue and Eccleſiaſticall; but</hi> quoad ſubſtantiam ſuam, <hi>or</hi> Cleri ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem, <hi>&amp;c. it is due by the Diuine Morall Law. And to the purpoſe of this diſtinction, they interprete the Leuiticall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of Tithes</hi> quoad ſubſtantiam, <hi>and</hi> quoad quotam. <hi>The</hi> quota <hi>being but a Iudiciall, or (as ſome will) a Ceremoniall Law, &amp;c]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what a ſtrange <hi>Diſtinguo</hi> is this, to diuide the <hi>Tenth,</hi> and <hi>quota?</hi> as if both were not one, The ſtrongeſt Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall imaginary abſtraction cannot ſeperate them. Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance indeed generally (and ſo is their meaning) may be free of a <hi>quota;</hi> but a <hi>Tenth</hi> cannot. But who taught them that Maintenance was Morall Diuine; and the <hi>quota,</hi> but Poſitiue and Eccleſiaſticall? Finde they any ſuch trickes in the two Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments?

                  <hi>Becauſe (forſooth) the Maintenance (ſay they) of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in Generall, is Morall, or Naturall, there being (according to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it ſe farre) the very</hi> Character <hi>of it written in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of mens hearts; that is, that Spirituall labourers are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with temporall bountie, as euery labourer is worthy of his hire. But</hi> quoad quotum, <hi>it is but a Iudiciall or Ceremoniall Law, &amp;c.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere haue wee, three Lawes to ponder, and to couche our Tithes vnder ſome one of them. Tithes to be Ceremoniall, is but a Ceremonie; and as ſoone done as ſpoken: no man euer durſt offer a proofe for it. To be Iudiciall, they cannot, Firſt, becauſe, that practiſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Vow of <hi>Iacob,</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee brought within the compaſſe of the Iewiſh Iudiciall Law: no, I ſay further, within no Law, meerely, or onely, Iewiſh. Conſider it well.</p>
               <p>Yea, Tithes Legally enacted, (as I doe thinke) cannot bee properly Iudiciall: For their Iudiciall Lawes (properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and without mixture) did concerne chiefly their Ciuill Common-wealth, and ſo, all the Tribes alike. But the Law of Tithes, went in fauours of onely <hi>Leui:</hi> a Law proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Prieſt-hood, before, and then to: to <hi>(All Prieſt-hood)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17637:80"/> Melchiſedechicall</hi> and <hi>Aaronicall:</hi> Euangelicall and Legal. Now how can either <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> or <hi>Aaron</hi> come vnder the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Law? It is more then I haue yet obſerued, if the Iudicial Law gaue any order for the Prieſt-hood: yea, the Change of the Prieſt-hood, made a change of the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec</hi> changed both Prieſthood and Law: not from what it was at firſt in that Typicall action betweene <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> but from what it was vnder the Law: the other he renued and reuiued. The Law then followeth the Prieſt-hood; and therefore the Iudicials, are no Iudges of things Sacerdotal and Sacred. Such Prieſt-hood then, ſuch Law. A Temporall and Ceremoniall Prieſt-hood, Temporall and Ceremoniall Lawes <hi>pro rata:</hi> ſuch was the Prieſt-hood and Law Leuiticall; in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things meerely Ceremoniall; and ſo gone for euer; in all things Temporall; and ſo, in ſome things, reuiued, renued, and reſtored in that firſt perpetuall and Euangelicall Prieſt-hood of <hi>Melchiſedec. Aeterna aeternis aptanda,</hi> is a receiued Maxime.</p>
               <p>Ceremoniall then, and Iudiciall are gone. There reſts but Morall: and ſo, if the enumeration of the three Lawes be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and the remotion of the two, true; it followeth, Tithes muſt be Morall But to Morallize yet a little more with them, What ſhall this Morall be? ſome will haue it all one with <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,</hi> that Character in our hearts: as if the Decalogue were but a ſecond edition of this Morall or Naturall Law. We may ſafely, yet we neede not, yeeld to all this. For take him in his true Etymon, and Morall will be, but, whatſoeuer concerneth <hi>Manners.</hi> Now euery particular point of good Manners hath not a perfect Character printed in our (fallen) hearts: Elſe, what ſay we to Polygamie, ſo long of olde tollerated; ſo much yet and in ſo many parts held for no ſinne? What ſay wee to <hi>Pauls</hi> Concupiſcence which he ſayes he had not knowne, but by the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. Then, Morall and Naturall are not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one. And was it not a very Morall and Mannerly duetie from <hi>Abraham</hi> to Chriſt, to pay Tithes for the maintenance of Gods Miniſterie? How then, it came to be not Morall or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly with Chriſt, let Schoole-men, Canoniſts, Ciuilians,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17637:81"/> Common-Lawyers, <hi>Et quot quot Sacri ſacra fame laborant,</hi> giue good reaſon for it, and I am ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Morall then, in that tripartite diuiſion of Lawes, is much better aſcribed, to whatſoeuer thing is brought vnder a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Law of God, neuer after to be abrogated, although the perfect Character of it be not imprinted in our corrupt Nature. Let vs ſay then of Tithes, We had not knowne them, but by the Law, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of Concupiſcence; yet let them haue the like continuance as that of Concupiſcence; elſe, giue vs a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall limit of the Law of Tithes from Scripture. But if Law ſhould faile; what ſay you to <hi>Melchiſedecs</hi> Prieſt-hood; and <hi>Abrahams</hi> practiſe; <hi>Dauids</hi> Prophecie; and <hi>Pauls</hi> application? all theſe were of Grace, and the Promiſes; not of the Law. Thus farre for Morall.</p>
               <p>Now let vs conſider of this <hi>Character</hi> by Nature in our hearts, they talke ſo much of. It is Naturall (ſay they) that the labourer haue his wages; the Miniſterie a Maintenance: but the <hi>quota</hi> is not of Nature, but Poſitiue Law; <hi>Ergo,</hi> An eleuenth, ninth, or leſſe, or more part may be aſſigned, as well as a Tenth. I anſwere, It is moſt true, that Nature is moſt liuely inſtructed with the Generals of all things; and the more ſhee draweth <hi>ad Indiuidua,</hi> the more erronious ſhee proueth. And touching this point of Commutatiue Iuſtice, it is ſo Naturall, that the very beaſts, yea ſauage beaſts, haue acknowledged it, by true Retribution. But is it not alſo a Character of our Nature, to draw all Wages, to their <hi>quota?</hi> or is there any doing in Nature, till this be done? Then, where Nature ſo bendeth, and cannot binde of it ſelfe, whatſoeuer may, or hath power to ſettle Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in theſe particulers, muſt be for euer the onely ſtay of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and Nature neuer truſted to it ſelfe afterwards, more then at firſt. To the point then.</p>
               <p>All Wages are due by a Wager to a Waged: Wagers and Waged heere, are either God, with his Creatures; or his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures among themſelues. Creatures in this caſe, haue no power ouer the <hi>quota,</hi> but <hi>ex mutuo pacto:</hi> and ſo, Nature can neuer define it, for all, and euer: but muſt vary after all Circumſtances. But betweene God and his Creatures (as our queſtion now
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17637:81"/> ſtandeth) God onely hath power of all: Who ſhall ſerue; How they ſhall ſerue; For what they ſhall ſerue: The <hi>quota,</hi> is firſt Gods, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 27. who dare refuſe it? Not <hi>Abraham,</hi> not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. Then God giueth this <hi>quota,</hi> to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, <hi>Melchiſedec, Leui:</hi> who dare except? Theſe be the true Poſitiue Lawes, enlightning and rectifying our darke and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Nature, to which we muſt euer either cleaue, or ſhew where our Nature hath preuailed againſt them: and how wee haue brought the Creator vnder <hi>mutuum pactum</hi> with his Creatures. No, he Wageth whom he will, for his Wine-yard: He giueth the Penny, the <hi>quota,</hi> for his wages: he that came firſt to work, excepted but proudly and idly againſt him that came laſt: A penny for all: a Tenth for all; It is not at our option. Though France, Spaine, Italy, Germany, the whole world, make any other Poſitiue Lawes, they make but ſo many Lawleſſe Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such Hiſtories, caſt but humane miſts, ouer Diuine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, if we truſt too much to them.</p>
               <p>Againe, although by Order of Nature (as Schooles ſpeake) the Generall of Wages goeth before the <hi>quota;</hi> yet in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Method, and point of Time there, you ſhall finde the very <hi>quota</hi> as ſoone, if not ſooner, then Maintenance in generall. Our firſt is ſtill, that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Tithe of all; heere is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>quota.</hi> Our ſecond is, <hi>Iacobs</hi> Vow, Tithe of all; againe the very <hi>quota.</hi> Our third is, the ſucceeding Lawes, all the Tithe of the Land is the Lords, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 27.30.

               <p>And that Scripture examples in ſuch caſes, doe binde vs, is cleare by all Scripture. The Acts of the Apoſtles, are all, but Examples; yet all, binde the Church in things incitable and ordinary. Chriſt, in waſhing his Diſciples feete, ſaid, Hee left them an example. Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of things to be auoided by vs, ſaith, thoſe things were written for Examples to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares and admonitions to vs, 1. Cor. 10. But to ſpeake home, In things euer and ordinarly done in Gods ſeruice before Law; euer vnder Law; and euer to be done till the end of the World; as is Maintenance for Gods Miniſtery; what ſhall bind vs, but the continuall Practiſes and Precepts recorded for our vſe in the Booke of God? Shall the Church then (as they ſpeake) without either example, or Law, wander in the wilderneſſe of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17637:82"/> her owne wantonneſſe: and becauſe God from all beginning hath ordained a Tenth for himſelfe, and his Miniſterie, Shee, Shee (forſooth) will giue him, a Ninth (but no feare of this) or Eleuenth, or what Shee liketh. What a proude inſolence is this?</p>
               <p>But alaſſe! When we ſhall aske thoſe Doctors, what they call their <hi>Church</hi> heere, that may ſo at her fancie diſpoſe of the <hi>quota</hi> for Gods Miniſters; how pitifully ſhall they be plunged in the puddle of their new Poſitions? For if we ſpeake in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Scripture Language, <hi>Church</hi> is often taken for the Flockes conſidered apart from their Paſtors; but neuer for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors apart from them. If they make this their <hi>Church,</hi> then they giue the onely people the power of appointing the <hi>quota,</hi> being the partie obliged to pay. Now this is againſt the very Character of Nature they talke ſo much of. If by <hi>Church,</hi> they vnd rſtand the <hi>Clergie,</hi> the <hi>Miniſterie,</hi> (as vſually is now done) This were to giue the onely Labourer power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his owne Wages, againſt the Character of Nature too. If they ioyne both parties for the <hi>Church;</hi> then it muſt goe <hi>ex mutuo Pacto:</hi> But this <hi>Pactum</hi> ſends God a packing, who is the onely Maſter Wager, Maſter of the Waged, and Wag s too; who taketh firſt to himſelfe the VVages, and th n by the Calling, conferreth them on his owne Miniſtery.

                  <hi>The third Opinion</hi> (ſaith Selden,) <hi>is of thoſe, who agree with the Canoniſts, that the right of the</hi> quota <hi>of Tithes, is immediately from the Morall or Diuine Naturall Law; ſome impudently vrging a commaundement giuen to</hi> Adam; <hi>others of them prouidently reſtraining all their Arguments to ſuch grounds for the concluſion, as many may bee had out of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams <hi>example, referred to the application of it in the Epiſtle to the</hi> Hebrewes; <hi>but others alſo not circumſpectly, taking in the Leuiticall Commandements of Tithes, for their moſt ſufficient authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here haue wee three grounds alleadged Hiſtorically, for proofe of Tithes to be Diuine, or Morall.

Touching the Leuiticall Law, I knewe neuer any (writing directly of this ſubiect) that ſet their <hi>greateſt</hi> force from <hi>Leui:</hi> at leſt, not I.

Selden</hi> did not as amply Hiſtorifie the reaſons drawne from it, as hee hath done for the firſt ground, being but weake: and that hee gaue not alſo his owne verdict of it, (which I hope had beene with the Veritie) as hee hath done againſt the firſt ground thus.</p>

Yet, that it was ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that had at leaſt in pretence many authours in the Church of England in the blinder time of our Aunceſters; I thence collect, for that in a penitentiall made for direction of Prieſts in auricular Confeſſion, and written (as my Copy is) about</hi> Henry <hi>the the ſixt, the Prieſtes examination and aduiſe vpon the point of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is thus expreſſed.</hi>

                  <hi>Hast thou truely done thy Tithings and Offerings to God and holy Chirch? Thou ſhalt vnderſtand that at the beginning of the world, when there was but O O man, that is to ſay,</hi> ADAM, <hi>God

And for as much as there was that time no man to receiue it of him in the name of holy Church, and God would not that they ſhould haue but nine parts, Therefore he commanded him that of euery thing, the Tithe part ſhould be burnt. I finde that afterward</hi> Adam <hi>had two ſonnes,</hi> Caine <hi>and</hi> Abel, Abel <hi>Tithed truely and of the beſt,</hi> Caine <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed falſely and of the worſt: at laſt the falſe Tither</hi> Caine <hi>ſlough</hi> Abel <hi>his brother.

Gen.</hi> 14. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and by the whole courſe of the Law, for <hi>Leui.</hi> The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is ſtrongly connected, becauſe, the Melchiſedecian Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood directly includeth the Euangelicall. Otherwiſe, we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17637:85"/> the whole Tipe and Veritie both: Wee turne all to a naked Hiſtory of <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. We belie <hi>Dauids</hi> Prophecy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. We diſclaime <hi>Pauls</hi> Aitiologie, Allegory, and Anagogicall application of all, to Chriſt, <hi>Heb:</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>But that that ſecond Tith, cannot now haue place, is cleare, becauſe <hi>Principio, Obiecto, Fine,</hi> that is, in all reſpects, they were meerely Ceremoniall: hauing for End, theſe typicall Feaſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed by Chriſt: for Place, onely the Temple at Ieruſalem. For Perſons, the Iewiſh houſeholders were the chiefe eaters. All theſe, are not onely <hi>mortua,</hi> but euen <hi>mortifera</hi> for our times.</p>

               <p>To this, I haue (I hope) proued. That Tithes are giuen for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, to the whole Tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> as well Prieſts, as Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Leuites; and ſo, though the Inferiours might be, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile receiuers &amp; leauiers, yet the whole Prieſthood was partner in the maine: ſo, the Iewiſh Laitie, paied their Tithes euen to the Leuiticall Prieſthood. As for the point of Succeſſion in this, Firſt, the Leuites paied onely <hi>decimam decimarum, the Tenth of Tithes,</hi> to <hi>Aaron,</hi> not to <hi>Aarons</hi> ſonnes, (as wee haue proued.) Now this Tithe was meerly Ceremoniall, being firſt an Heaue Offering; 2. tied onely to the High-Prieſt in Perſon: and 3. to Ieruſalem for Place. <hi>Ergo,</hi> not due now. Secondly, no proper Succeſſion of the Goſpell to the Law: onely <hi>tempore;</hi> neither in Perſon aſtricted to a Tribe, not in the ſame nature or Order of Prieſthood: the true Succeſſion is <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> to <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> where all things paſt, <gap reason="foreign">

The intervening Law, was but as a droppe, (yet of <hi>Diuine</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too) in the bottome of a baſon, appointed for a time to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, to diuide, nay, rather to drawe on, and ioyne two ſtreames of approching Grace, the Promiſes, and their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: which meeting, this droppe was quite ſwallowed vp by their fulneſſe; what it had of the firſt Fountaine, common
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17637:85"/> with thoſe two Streames, Naturall, or Morall; that was ſtill retained, being onely graced with new Euangelicall garments: What it had in the propertie of a <hi>Partition wall,</hi> Rites, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, all euaniſhed, as Mercurie from the fire. So Tithes, Inheritance being of the firſt Fountaine, common, Morall, to all theſe Water-workes of Gods worſhip, and therefore mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that Droppe of the Law, could neuer be dried vp, but recouer ſo much greater ſtrength by the meeting, of thoſe two Streames, as the Performances, ſurpaſſe the Promiſes: and the Goſpell, the Law.</p>

                  <hi>where the knowledge of</hi> Fact <hi>proceeds.

               </p>
               <p>Of this poſition, would I faine haue a better reaſon then I can perceiue for our queſtion: for who will think that the truth of Diuine precept muſt rely vpon knowledge of <hi>Fact?</hi> ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the <hi>Fact</hi> muſt be truſted to Fabulous authors, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things. Indeed, when the <hi>Fact</hi> is recorded in the Tables of the Precept, there may a man argue reciprocally <hi>a Cauſis ad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta;</hi> and <hi>contra:</hi> But to bring in <hi>Talmud, Targum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Selden, Reuiew. p. <hi>55</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Gema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> to teach vs, from what they ſay was done, what ſhould beene done by the Law, it is, (in my iudgement) quite out of ſquare. For firſt, I may iuſtly doubt if their relation be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we all haue found them in ſome, erroneous: <hi>viz:</hi> in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Herbs, as aforeſaid: and in confounding the Lords fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Precepts of keeping ſo many holy Feaſts yeerely; and <hi>thrice a yeere;</hi> in a Leape-yeere each third yeere; and ſo making the Tithes for Feaſts; not paieable each third yeere. Certainely, if I belieue thoſe men in any thing it ſhalbe more for reuerence of the Text, then their Tales.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though their relation of the <hi>Fact</hi> were true in their times; yet might it be much degenerate from the former ages.<note place="margin">Buxtorfus, de opere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is true, the not diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one Tithe from another, hath made men confound all, and take the Morall for the Ceremoniall. But whence, I pray, ſhall we draw our true diſtinction? from the Text, or <hi>Talmud?</hi> Whether ſhall the Text tell Talmud, what Tithes were to bee payed; or Talmud tell vs, what Tithes the Text ſhould haue enioyned? So Tithes are by Scripture moſt clearely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; and by Talmud meerely confounded.</p>
               <p>Thus farre (Reader) haue I, for thee, trod the pathes of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Seldens</hi> Hiſtorie of Tithes, adding my owne Simple iudgement <hi>De Iure:</hi> Both may ſtand together, in regard of my plaine Poſitions from Scripture, for the one; and his owne Proteſtations, that he meant nothing to the contrarie, in his Hiſtorie. Yea, I aſcribe it to Gods ſpeciall prouidence, that He, and I, ſhould at one time, as twinnes from one belly, both come forth together: and that I, who (as I take it) was by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the <hi>Eſau,</hi> and elder brother in this buſineſſe, yet, in our birth, ſhould proue a <hi>Iacob,</hi> catching his Hiſtorie (as it were) by the heele; leſt the incurious Reader (as is ſaid) by too hot hunting the wilde Hiſtorie, might defraud <hi>Iacob,</hi> that is, the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and <hi>Goſpell,</hi> of their due Primogeniture in the Right of Tithes.</p>
               <p>My laſt aduice then is, That howſoeuer Hiſtoricall varietie may delight thine eare; yet let onely Scripture-Verity leade thine heart, and direct thy Conſcience to the Concluſion in things pertaining to God: to whoſe Bleſſing I doe recommend theſe my Labours, for thy Edification. <hi>Amen.</hi>
